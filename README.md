# gff-project
An incomplete Java-based, Christian-themed computer game that I made as a personal project. You explore a procedurally-generated (random) world collecting books of the Bible which are kept in treasure chests. Along the way, you can meet people, visit churches and hear sermons, and fight with devils by trying to guess the correct verse/reference for randomly-chosen Bible verses. (The closer your guess is to the actual reference, the stronger your attack will be.)

This is a complete Java project (though the game itself is incomplete) which can be loaded into the latest NetBeans IDE. It can also be run by executing the GoodFight.jar, GoodFight.bat (Windows), or GoodFight.exe (Windows) file in the 'GFF' directory.

The program runs in full-screen mode.

Controls: Arrow keys move the player. F2 opens the Bible book selection subscreen; check obtained books to use them in enemy encounters. F5 opens the world map subscreen. Esc key exits from any subscreen, or from the game if no subscreen is open.

Notes:
- The only functional options on the Main Menu right now are New Game and Exit. Use the mouse to click them.
- The shortcut buttons at the top of the screen are non-functional at this point: just use F2 & F5 to access the two available subscreens as noted above.
- Find milk/meat/strong meat in brown chests, or visit a church to hear a sermon, to restore your "faith" (player health).
- At this point, the game may accidentally spawn objects like churches and doors in inaccessible places. If this happens and you get stuck, just restart the game. It shouldn't happen *too* often.
- See test-info_manual.txt for additional information intended for testers.
