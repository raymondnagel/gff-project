In the name of the LORD will I destroy thee!
Depart, thou unclean spirit!
Father, strengthen thou me according unto thy word!
Let the word of the Lord have free course!
The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation!
I am on the LORD's side!
I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts!
The battle is the LORD's!
Thus saith the LORD!
