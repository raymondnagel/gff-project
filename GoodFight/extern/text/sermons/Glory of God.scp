$`Preacher`The scripture says, "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;" (Romans 3:23)
$`Preacher`Man, who was made in the image of God to have God's glory, has come short of that glory because of his sin.
$`Preacher`For example, part of God's glory is his righteousness; and by sin, we have all lost the glory of righteousness.
$`Preacher`But Jesus Christ came to restore that glory, by giving us his righteousness - the righteousness of God: "For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him." (2 Cor. 5:21)
$`Preacher`Therefore Christ prayed to the Father, "And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:" (John 17:22)
$`Preacher`Wherefore John testifies of our final gathering, the heavenly Jerusalem, as "Having the glory of God..." (Rev. 21:10-11)
$`Preacher`God said in the Old Testament, "My glory will I not give to another..." (Isaiah 48:11)
$`Preacher`But Christ was given the glory of God: for he is not another. He and his Father are one! (John 10:30)
$`Preacher`And now, being IN Christ... we also are made partakers of his glory! (1 Peter 5:1) Praise the Lord!
