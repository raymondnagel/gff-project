$`Preacher`The scripture says, "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast." (Ephesians 2:8-9)
$`Preacher`The grace that bringeth salvation is not of us: there is no work that we can do do earn it. Grace is God's gift.
$`Preacher`"Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness." (Romans 4:4-5)
$`Preacher`God only requires that we have faith: that we believe God's record of his Son, Jesus Christ; and that we trust in that grace he provided for us at Calvary.
$`Preacher`Then God does the work of salvation: as it is written, "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them." (Ephesians 2:10)
$`Preacher`And again, "Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life." (Titus 3:5-7)
$`Preacher`Thanks be to God for the unspeakable gift of his grace!
