To create a Section:

1. start with a room
2. for each direction, if there is already a room, OR if the point is outside the map dimensions, place a wall
3. for remaining directions that are open (there should be 0-3; 0-4 if this is the entrance room), either put up a wall, or expand section into a new room there
4. wherever a wall section is open, add it to a "pending" list to be completed later
4. using the new room, or one from the "pending" list, repeat from step 1 until a dead end is created, or the room # limit is reached.
